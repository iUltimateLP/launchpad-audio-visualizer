### Made possible by these awesome guys:

### Bass.NET license    
Note: This software depends on Bass.NET and that library has certain license requierements. In order to come of terms of the agreements, I can't put the registration key in the source code, so if you build this app on your own, you will see the BASS.NET splash screen appearing at the start of the application. However, you can request your own key [here](http://bass.radio42.com/bass_register.html) and put it in the BassNet.Register function [here](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/launchpad-audio-visualizer/blob/master/launchpad-audio-vis/AudioAnalyzer.cs#L76)
